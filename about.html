      <h2>Who, What, and Why is PLArmory?</h2>
      <p>Salutations, and welcome to PLArmory! 
    This is a very small business that I have started in my sophmore year of college.
    I am a massive fan of all things DND and RenFaire, which has led me to design and develop my own props, from swords to staves.
    This hobby eventually caught the attention of some of my friends, who I've made props for as well.
    Therefore, following the wise words of my grandfather, "If you're good at something, never do it for free", I have decided to start this small business!
    I have a part-time job as a student worker at my college, where I am majoring in Design and minoring in Medieval and Renaissance History. 
    I love what I do, and if I could turn this into a successful business, I would be OVER THE MOON!
    Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions, comments, or concerns!</p>

      <h3>Our Process</h3>
      <p>Every prop begins with a wooden core, usually a dowel that I source from a hardware store. 
        Then, that core is measured and treated, and sometimes cut down to the necessary size.
        After core processing, the 3D modeling process begins. 
        I have a few standard techniques that I like to employ for more basic designs, but I won't give away too much of my secrets here :D.
        Once the model is finished, it goes to 3D printing, usually with PLA, but sometimes other filament types are employed.
        Once the 3D printing is finished, the pieces are detached from the bed, and sheathed over the wooden core, creating your prop!
